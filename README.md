******Important*****
The database used to test this API is a local host database, I will add the .csv data files as well sql scripts in this repository. 

***How to Run***
1. Clone the repository to local system.
2. Setup the database using MySQL Workbench.
3. Change the connection string in appsettings.json file. (Because this is an assessment I have included the whole connectionString).
4. Make sure the table names in Visual Studios AppDbContext file is the same as in MySQL database.
5. All the scenarios were completed for the assessment.
6. I used a public database the link to which I will attach down below, this was a larger dataset so I truncated and limited the data.
